# Samoyed Game - Save Polish UX Features

## Summary

This document describes the comprehensive UX polish features added to the Samoyed Care Game, including save functionality, day/night cycle, notifications, sound effects, and accessibility improvements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced State Management

#### New Atom State
- **`lastSavedAt`**: Tracks when the game was last saved (timestamp)
- **`gameClock`**: Game time in milliseconds (advances 1 hour per real minute)
- **`soundEnabled`**: User preference for sound effects
- **`notificationsAtom`**: Queue of game notifications with dismiss state
- **`dayPhaseAtom`**: Computed atom for current day phase (Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night)

#### New Types
- `DayPhase`: Enum for Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night
- `GameNotification`: Interface for notification objects (type, message, stat, timestamp, dismissed)

### 2. Auto-Save System

#### Implementation
- **Auto-save interval**: Every 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- **Save on state changes**: Tracked via `lastSavedAt` timestamp
- **Manual save**: Button in GameHUD with visual feedback
- **Success feedback**: Toast notification with success sound effect
- **Persistent storage**: All game state stored in localStorage with SSR guards

#### User Experience
- HUD displays last saved time
- Save button shows loading animation during save
- Toast notifications confirm successful saves
- Failure handling with error toast

### 3. Day/Night Cycle

#### Time System
- **Game clock**: Advances 60 minutes (game time) per 1 minute (real time)
- **Day phases**:
  - Dawn: 5am-8am (orange/pink gradient)
  - Day: 8am-5pm (pink/purple/blue gradient)
  - Dusk: 5pm-8pm (orange/red/purple gradient)
  - Night: 8pm-5am (indigo/purple/blue dark gradient)

#### Visual Effects
- Background gradient transitions smoothly (1 second duration)
- Scene backgrounds darken during night/dusk
- Text colors adjust for readability (white at night)
- HUD displays current phase with emoji indicator

#### Gameplay Integration
- **Sleep availability**: Rest action highlighted with star icon during nighttime
- **Better rest bonus**: Visual indicator that sleeping at night is optimal

### 4. Notifications System

#### Trigger Logic
- **Critical threshold**: Stats ‚â§ 10% (red notification with üö®)
- **Warning threshold**: Stats ‚â§ 30% (yellow notification with ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- **Rate limiting**: Max 1 notification per stat per minute
- **Auto-check**: Runs on every stat change

#### User Interface
- **Dismissible**: Click √ó to dismiss individual notifications
- **Auto-cleanup**: Dismissed notifications removed after 5 minutes
- **Sound cues**: Optional audio alert on notification (respects sound toggle)
- **Animation**: Slide-in from right with smooth transition
- **Priority colors**: Red (critical), Yellow (warning), Blue (info), Green (success)

#### Accessibility
- ARIA live regions (assertive for critical, polite for others)
- Screen reader friendly messages
- Keyboard accessible dismiss buttons

### 5. Sound Effects System

#### Audio Files
Located in `/public/samoyed-game/sfx/`:
- `feed.mp3` - Feeding action
- `play.mp3` - Playing action
- `clean.mp3` - Cleaning action
- `rest.mp3` - Resting action
- `notification.mp3` - Stat warnings
- `success.mp3` - Save success

#### Implementation
- **User gesture requirement**: Respects browser autoplay policies
- **Volume control**: All sounds normalized to 0.2-0.3 volume
- **Toggle control**: HUD button to enable/disable sounds
- **Persistent preference**: Sound state saved to localStorage
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if audio fails to load

#### User Experience
- First interaction enables sound context
- Visual feedback (toast) when toggling sound
- Test sound plays when enabling
- No jarring volume levels

### 6. Responsive Design

#### Mobile Optimizations (< 640px)
- **HUD**: Smaller buttons, icon-only save button
- **Notifications**: Full-width with reduced padding
- **Scene buttons**: Compact spacing
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44√ó44px
- **Status/Action panels**: Reduced padding (4 units vs 6)

#### Desktop Enhancements (‚â• 1024px)
- **Grid layout**: 2-column layout (viewport + panels)
- **Larger touch targets**: Full button text visible
- **More spacing**: Comfortable padding throughout

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Focus states**: Visible ring on all interactive elements
- **Tab order**: Logical flow through UI
- **Button focus**: 2px ring with offset on all buttons

### 7. Accessibility Features

#### ARIA Labels
- All buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- Progress bars use `role="progressbar"` with value attributes
- Notifications use `aria-live` regions
- Scene buttons use `aria-pressed` state
- Emoji elements use `role="img"` with labels

#### Screen Reader Support
- Stat levels announced with percentage
- Mood changes announced
- Notification messages read aloud
- Day phase changes announced
- Save confirmation announced

#### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast colors throughout
- Color-blind friendly (not relying on color alone)
- Focus indicators always visible
- Text readable in all day phases

## Component Architecture

### New Components
1. **`GameHUD`**: Top-left overlay with save, sound, and time display
2. **`NotificationPanel`**: Top-right notification stack

### Updated Components
1. **`GameLayout`**: Day/night background transitions
2. **`SceneViewport`**: Scene lighting based on day phase
3. **`ActionPanel`**: Sound effects, sleep bonus indicator
4. **`StatusPanel`**: ARIA attributes, responsive padding
5. **`SamoyedGameShell`**: Auto-save, clock advance, notification checks

### New Utilities
1. **`sound-effects.ts`**: Sound system with gesture detection
2. **`calculateDayPhase()`**: Converts game clock to day phase
3. **`getStatLabel()`**: Human-readable stat names

## Technical Details

### State Persistence
- Uses `atomWithStorage` from Jotai
- SSR-safe with `unstable_getOnInit: true`
- Namespaced keys: `samoyed-game:*`
- Hydration guards prevent SSR mismatches

### Performance Considerations
- Intervals optimized (1 min, 2 min, 5 min)
- Notifications rate-limited
- Smooth CSS transitions (GPU-accelerated)
- Minimal re-renders via Jotai selectors

### Browser Compatibility
- Audio API with fallback
- MP3 format (universal support)
- Modern CSS features (backdrop-blur, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS for consistency
