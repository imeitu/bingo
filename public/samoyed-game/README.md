# Samoyed Care Game

A delightful pet simulation game built with Next.js, Jotai state management, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Pet Care System**: Monitor and maintain your Samoyed's hunger, happiness, cleanliness, and energy levels
- **Multiple Scenes**: Navigate between Home, Park, Kitchen, Bedroom, and Bathroom
- **Dynamic Moods**: Your pet's mood changes based on their stats (Happy, Sad, Hungry, Sleepy, Dirty, Excited)
- **Inventory System**: Use food items and toys to interact with your pet

### Save System
- **Auto-Save**: Game state automatically saves every 2 minutes
- **Manual Save**: Click the Save button in the HUD to save immediately with visual feedback
- **Persistent Storage**: All game data stored in browser localStorage with SSR hydration guards

### Day/Night Cycle
- **Dynamic Time System**: Game clock advances in real-time (1 minute real = 1 hour game time)
- **Four Day Phases**: Dawn (5am-8am), Day (8am-5pm), Dusk (5pm-8pm), Night (8pm-5am)
- **Visual Feedback**: Background gradients and scene lighting change with time of day
- **Sleep Bonus**: Rest action is highlighted during nighttime for better energy recovery

### Notifications System
- **Smart Alerts**: Automatic notifications when stats drop below warning (30%) or critical (10%) thresholds
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents notification spam (1 notification per stat per minute)
- **Dismissible**: Click Ã— to dismiss individual notifications
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Old dismissed notifications are cleared after 5 minutes
- **Visual Priority**: Critical (red), Warning (yellow), Info (blue), Success (green)

### Sound Effects
- **Action Sounds**: Audio feedback for feed, play, clean, and rest actions
- **Notification Sounds**: Audio cues for stat warnings
- **User-Controlled**: Toggle sound effects on/off via HUD button
- **Gesture-Aware**: Respects browser autoplay policies and user interaction requirements
- **Files Located**: `/public/samoyed-game/sfx/` (currently minimal placeholders)

### Accessibility & Responsive Design
- **ARIA Labels**: All interactive elements have proper aria-labels
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with visible focus states
- **Progress Bars**: Stats displayed with proper ARIA progressbar roles
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts from mobile (stacked) to desktop (grid)
- **Mobile Optimized**: Smaller touch targets and simplified mobile HUD
